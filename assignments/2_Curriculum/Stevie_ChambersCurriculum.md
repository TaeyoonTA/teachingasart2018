## MYstory

Thinking back to my high-school sophomore year self, I remember lots of changes, and lots of different types of class that may have prepared me for exams and the following years’ classes but didn’t satisfy me as an individual. Given the opportunity to create a curriculum for my younger self, I thought of not only myself, but also what other students might have needed and/or wanted and worked from there.

## Teaching Philosophy

Ideally, the college prep school would have 3 tracks for students to choose from as they enter their sophomore year: STEAM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Art, Math), Political Science, and Business. Students in the different tracks would still have classes that intersect, but many of the course options available for each specific track will speak closely to the interests of the student. Because I attended grade schools primarily consisting of Black students, many of us never learning “new” or “more” about our cultural backgrounds, I found it really important to make this something that is at the base of several of the courses offered in my curriculum.

The following images show a student’s Sophomore Curriculum plan for a full year. All of the classes offered for Stevie, who is on the STEAM track, are listed. The highlighted classes are those Stevie chose for both the Fall 2006 semester (the first two quarters of the academic year, as in college) and the Spring 2007 semester. *FYI, the 2006-07 academic school year is when I spent my crazy time as a sophomore in real life!*

## Learning Objective

STEAM track students will engage in a variety of classes that are intended to enhance practical, technical, visual, performing and other skills, and that all require considerate levels of reading, writing, personal and group research, and analytical thinking.

## Learning Outcome

Students will gain the skills and knowledge needed to be truly adaptable, reflective, proactive, well-rounded, culturally aware leaders as they prepare for life after grade school.

## Some Class Descriptions

**Dance** : Ballet, Modern, Jazz, African, & Latin Dance styles are studied and practiced across two full semesters. Dance students must take this course for both semesters.

**Colorful Lenses** : History course taught using researched material primarily provided by real people with real stories from varying ethnic backgrounds. Students will learn history as it was passed down generationally, and compose a final project in the form of a documentary.

**AfroBeats** : Music History course that engages students in a hierarchical chronicle of music, from its inception to now, with special emphasis on the jazz and reggae styles, and hip hop culture.

**Electives** : Exactly what they sound like! Leadership Development is required for all 4 years. This course and one other elective (per semester) would operate on a block schedule. They allow for time to work on projects, hone in on basic skills, and go to events geared to the respective elective.
