I can’t say that I look back on high school with fondness. Socially it was interesting and there were certainly classes that held my interest, but on the hole it wasn’t an ideal learning experience and most of what I learned has proven fairly useless in my adult life. Looking back, I feel a sense of detachment from my high school experience, more like I was a spectators to my  own learning rather than participants. 

If I was given the keys to the kingdom and could have designed a curriculum for my 10th grade self, I would have taken a much more multidisciplinary approach that focused on collaborative projects and hands-on learning over the pure lecture format that I was subjected to in my teens. I have found that I learn best through doing, so a strong emphasis on doing and the ability to apply concepts would be core to the learning process.

## Teaching Philosophy

The goal of this curriculum is to instill a love of learning in students. To accomplish this, we employ play, collaboration, and external context to all of our subjects. Faculty pay close attention to the performance of their students, helping guide them to subjects that best suit their individual skill sets and interests. As an institution, we aim to produce, curious, resilient, adaptable, and creative citizens. 

## Curriculum Structure

Classes are organized by humanities, sciences, and social sciences and encompass overlapping modules that address the fundamentals and subdisciplines of these three overarching subject areas. 

Students can take up to 6 classes from any of the three subject areas but are required to take at least one from each every semester. Students can mix and match classes from the three main subject areas based on their interest. At the beginning and end of every semester, our faculty advisors meet with each student to go over their academic, professional, and personal goals, and to develop a schedule of classes for the next 6 months.

Classes are a hybrid of lecture, labs, and discussions, with project-based assignments every 2 weeks. Every class consists of at least two large group projects (midterm and final). Classes in each of the three main areas are not segregated from each other like in most schools; humanities incorporate science and math for both inspiration and creative medium; science and math classes address the historical, political, and economic implications of the concepts taught; and the social sciences courses focus on the impact of the arts and sciences on society. Projects and a focus on promoting work with both a student’s mind and hands ensure that both academic, university bound students and non-academic students are equally supported.

## Learning Objectives

Students will graduate with a strong foundational knowledge of key concepts in the humanities, sciences, and social science, as well as practical skills that aid in life outside of the classroom. Our objective is to ensure our students have plenty of options after graduation: they can go on to university if they want to, or they can go directly into the workforce. 

## Learning Outcomes

Students graduate with an appreciation for the interconnectedness of their studies, a thirst for independent learning, and ability to work well independently or collaborate with their peers, faculty, and members of industry. Our curriculum cultivates cross functional, perpetual learners who have a broad portfolio of work by the time they graduate.
