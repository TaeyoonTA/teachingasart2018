# **Recollection**

My high school days was a bitter-sweet experience that is still etched in my mind. In retrospect, the system and curriculum that I went through was an organised chaos. It was vigorous and daunting, at times, I felt I was in a communist led country where high discipline must be instilled and restrictions a plenty. The school expected high standards of results from each student, it was competitive, if you fall behind, your peers row the boat on their own forward. Albeit the tough conditions at a growing age, there are some teachers that made studying a joyful experience, others are just there to do their job and instill fear in us. I did believe that there was a dire need to change (then) and add more values to the education curriculum in Singapore. When in school, I felt like I was clouded by fear of failing. Being surrounded by  teachers who are intimidating was not even helpful to my timid disposition. It affected me psychologically but, fortunately not to the extreme end. I had a few close friends, but many were pretentious, there was a lack in community bondness. I studied for the sake of grades, and I could not relate my academic rigour to real life application. I was not well-informed of the happenings globally, references was made on information that is within the bubble. Everything felt back-dated. I firmly believe that education is a means of seeing, as a means of knowing thus honing competencies and consciously and visually literate in domains that I was clearly lack of such as self, community, globally and technology. With the right curriculum, it could propel the development of a studentâ€™s cognitive and emotional abilities, while providing opportunities to build positive relationships for oneself and with others.

The nature of a good education curriculum nurtures a learner and encourage them towards achieving global literacy and awareness. With my given history in education, it lacked lustre and was too academic stringent. I am interested in exploring experimental education that fosters technical skills without compromising academic excellence and at the same time giving the learner global presence and technology advancement. The curriculum would also allow opportunities to collaborate with one another from time to time and heighten the community spirit. 

## **Learning Objective**

Creating a full immersive education experience using tools that make students a global learner.

## **Learning Outcome**

To develop a conscious well-rounded  individual in the self, community and global domains giving them a sense of identity, making connections by immersing in sensory experiences and finding purpose in life and personal experiences.

## **The Academic Experience**
The curriculum falls under the umbrella of the domains mentioned above. The academic structure does not focus solely on written exams as a form of grading, students are graded based on the following:

30% - Group Collaboration
30% - Individual growth
20% - Learner led initiatives 
20% - Attendance 

Classroom structures are modest in size, 15 students per class. This allow individual personalised learning with the learner and the teacher. Collaborative learning is highly encourage as it provide a well-rounded education for the learners. The use of technology is fully integrated in the learning of all subjects at the school. All learners have a MacBook so they cam access online learning environment and the Internet.

The following domains are intertwined among each subject. 

**Self-identity & relationships**
Self-discovery and how they relate to others through self-expression (i.e. personality and style)

**Eg: Art & Design**  
Learners encourage to find a cause within the community and awareness through visual communication. 

**Narrative**
Taking a narrative approach towards developing socio-emotional awareness

**Eg:Business & English**
Learners would perform a student led Theatre play at the end of every semester. 
Learners would create a bi-weekly open flea market that would allow them to make profit (i.e. Sellings bakes). The profits will then be used to make necessary arrangements for their business to blosssom (i.e. Marketing).

**Nature**
Observing the different terrains and landscapes in nature. Using natural materials and found objects to explore relations with the subject. 

**Eg: Physical Education / Geography**
Learners will have a bi-weekly run/jog in the natural terrain. While there, students are encourage to observe the terrain and discuss about their observations in class. 

**Technology & Traditions**
Exploring established approaches towards experiments. 

**Eg: Mathematics / Science**
Experimenting, questioning and exploring the definition of science through labs and findings locally and globally (exchange of ideas with students from other schools)
