As a young student, I think it is imperative that learning centers not only around academic comprehension of base material.  Societal structure dictates that we go to school, get jobs, pay taxes, etc.  While these are necessary evils, for lack of a better term, the manner in which we’re taught results in being more motivated by societal needs than those of the individual.  

I attended a progressive public high school in a suburban town outside of Boston, MA.  A town where high(er) taxes are notably for the purpose of funding the school systems.  My high school’s mantra of “Think for yourself, but think of others” is indicative of the tone that pulses throughout the educational structure; there was noticeable emphasis placed on core values of respect and individuality.  While I’m appreciative to have studied in such a place, the academic structure was similar to most, likely having to do with standardized state requirements.  In 10th grade, the core class structure consisted of Geometry, Biology, Art (elective choice), foreign language (typically Spanish/French), American Literature, History, and Physical Education.  While all of these are core subjects for forming well-rounded young adults, what lacked was the bonding agent between them.  Additionally, prior to entering an undergraduate program, there was little offered toward advancement for students who excelled in any one of these areas resulting in a shallow knowledge base in all of them.

**Foundational Curriculum**

In designing a curriculum for my 10th grade self, I’ve thought about how I could have better performed in the educational setting while still learning the fundamentals.  It is important for students to understand the relationships between what they’re learning, and the role that it plays in becoming a contributor.  

I agree that the subjects mandated by the state are important however I think additional attention should be paid toward self-awareness and interest building.  My curriculum offers similar subjects to traditional schooling, however making sense of the studies as a whole through an additional class to assist in synthesizing the curriculum as a whole.  While this assignment focuses on 10th grade alone, the benefits of such a structure will be more visible throughout the entire course of a high school career.  Each subject will operate in silo to focus on academics, with individualized commentary at the synthesis level ed by academic advisors from those areas.  A place where students are grouped with like-minded classmates to discuss, acclimate, and belong.  This discussion time will replace one subject as decided by the student and his/her advisor to allow for a more individualized and weighted course load.  Those more interested in a particular subject will meet with others in that domain for more advanced exploration, and for troubleshooting difficulties elsewhere.

**Curriculum Objective**

Students will learn base geometry, biology, american literature, foreign languages, history, and physical education with a community of similar students to guide their interests and help in struggling areas.  

**Curriculum Outcome**

Students will obtain specialized knowledge in their particular passions while improving well roundedness through comfortable discussion..  As a result, students will be better equipped for advanced study in later years.
