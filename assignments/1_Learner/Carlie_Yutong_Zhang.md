Learning something new is always a big decision for me. There are so many unknown stuffs out there and it’s impossible for me the learn everything during lifetime. Then making the choice of what to pick and what to give up for now is hard because of the limited time we have. So once I made the choice, I always searching on the materials and resources carefully. I would compare different books, tutorials and websites and view their comments. I am so careful with and spend so much time on it and this is the part that stopped me most from learning.

For me, I can never be familiar with what I’m going to learn. The tutorial, the book, or the teacher, (I will call them the LEAD) will be the key factor leading me during the process and will also affect a lot if I can learn it well and my learning experience. 

It’s not just how much knowledge the LEAD knows, but also how the LEAD designs the structure and assigns content into different days/classes. I’ve experienced the LEAD who is an export of the area but used too much professional words and only talked about the theory and logics instead of giving examples for students to play with. In those cases, I had to force myself being patient. 

It’s also the “interface” of the LEAD, which could be the book size, the website layout, a human teacher’s language style, and even the background music some video tutorials use. As a fan of paper books, many of my coding skills were learnt with books. There was a book with good written but it’s too thick with the paper size not big enough. So it’s always hard for me to hold it at a page. I ended up finishing only half of it.  That was the first time made me noticing that learning is a whole physical and mental experience surrounded with the knowledge itself. 


Then after getting the material, I would just follow the guide and repeat learning for a few days. From researching the repeating process, I got something I want to call learning memory. For one hand, it helps me have better choices on picking materials and make the repeat learning plan better next time. For another, whether the useful resources that I found or the effort and materials that seems to be useless at the time are saved somewhere online or offline. They most times helped me eventually when I try to use what I learn. 

From the repeating process, I also got fresh knowledge and memories. Sometimes I learnt for a clear reason that I need to use the skill immediately. I would put it directly into practice. In other cases, I learnt something for future use and even only for inspirations. I wouldn’t use it at the moment. Therefore, those fresh knowledges became blur memories. However, I don’t feel I forget it. It’s stored somewhere deep in my brain and when I need to use it, I will go back to my learning memory and this time I can quickly locate the key points I need and see the practices/examples I did before. Learning memory to me is always like a cloud library that I can go search and download to local tests. 

In the learning map, I describe the final result after practicing as “solid”. It’s just an ideal description and in real life I always need to at some level go back to learning memory and waking up my blur memory when using the knowledge. Personally speaking, I could never say that I finish learning something but just getting more and more familiar with it.
