**Intro**

Right when I was about to construct my first sentence of this assignment, questions started to flood out - Should I google how to write an autobiography? Should I search for essays on learning and being a student? I haven’t written an essay for quite a while, should I take a crash course on writing 101? What music should I put on while I’m writing my autobiography? Hey, remember that article on binaural beats assisting mind concentration, maybe that will be good for writing, let me take a look at that first. 3 hours go by.
 

**Chapter One**

Diagnosed by self, Ziyu is an advanced wonderer when learning. A wonderer is a person who is not goal oriented, who is sensitive to changes, who does not think in a linear pattern. I often catch myself in the act of researching about a topic completely unrelated to the initial subject matter I was set to tackle on. This type of learner disorder can often cause self-doubt, loose of self meaning, even initial subject destruction. However, a wonderer learner could also land into unexpected territories, arriving at destinations far beyond previous imaginations. 


**Chapter Two**

The abundance of second-hand experiences and pro-tips from the internet is one of the first steps of research for me. As an individual who is keen to visuals, I tend to search for visual information rather than pure text. I often find myself starting from Youtube then to Google Image then to Google all. I tend to look for visual inspirations when it comes to creative subjects. If the subject matter leans on the academic or skill related side, I tend to set a middle goal that is visual based in order to stimulate my understandings of the subject better or to motivate me experiment and iterate more. For example, while I was learning python to process text, I spent time researching on visual poems and text art, and set a middle goal to generate visual poems with python.

Besides searching and reading through authoritative information, more and more I realized the magic of simply just talking to others on matters related to the subject, it is ever surprising the outcome of intimate conversations with others. The intimacy and subtly of a person to person conversation, also provides fluidity and complete new perspectives that one can simply not gain from typing search words on Google.


**Chapter Three**

The creating time is the hardest yet most rewarding part of learning for me. I used to have the addiction of wanting to get it right on the first go, a second try was my biggest nightmare. It is when self doubt grows like a big monster and haunts me in the head. An emotionally turbulent learner. I realized that I had an end result welded in my mind already, a pre-constructed ending of a story. One of my biggest enemy of learning - premature expectations. I learned in a hard way to let that go. To blindfold my expectations of the end result, to allow myself time and space to experiment and iterate unconditionally. With that freedom, then can I truly appreciate the creation, and reach a temporary state of satisfaction.
