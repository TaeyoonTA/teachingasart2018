## Providence, 2012

One of my fondest memories of learning takes place in my freshman year at RISD, with my professor Christina Bertoni.

To describe Christina: A silver-haired sculptor with wide blue eyes, and grandmotherly hands. She makes work about bodies and birds, through the medium of wood and mud. There’s something very earthly and grounding about her– a generous, wide, gentle presence.

Fridays in her Spatial Dynamics class, we would abandon the classroom and go on walks in springtime Providence. Pointing out flowers, architecture, changes in topography. Walking for the sake of walking.

*“Get to know your city,”* she would say. Your environment affects your mind in ways you can’t always see.

This experience has stayed with me for years. I’ve written before about how walking to me is a form of thinking with your body– how you can come to new conclusions moving through a city:

>Respect the body, notice this—
>All the sensory data moving into you. And how everything that interfaces with your biological sensors is getting turned into ELECTRICITY through your skin and assorted other membranes.
>I used to think about the brain as existing and operating separately from the body. I treated the body as if it were inferior to the mind.
>Now my experience acknowledges how the body thinks, with its own world intelligence. The sensing is a type of thinking. The walking, without aim, is a kind of creativity. 

And vice versa, a kind of mental circumambulation can happen. You can think furiously in circles, you can travel forward, find new mental paths to old places. It’s the act of shifting attention through new space, through new space…

I’m very drawn to ways of making knowledge that aren’t purely rectangular, glowing, constrained to the abstract intellect. Even the “ultimate intellectual activity,” of writing, requires hands and bones.

So I think this about thinking— that making knowledge also means walking, and making, and talking, and eating, and breathing, and sleeping, and loving.

## What about learning?

I think of times I’ve explored a new city, or taken a walk through the woods. Learning to me feels like wandering through a new stretch of land.

Sometimes you come in with a clear intention, wanting to get from point A to point B. 

Sometimes it happens without intention at all— you explore for the pleasure of it. You find yourself discovering that two paths connect, without realizing: “Oh, I’ve been here before.”

Other times you find yourself completely lost, in a difficult way. I can definitely think of times last semester at ITP where I was frustrated to tears. I didn’t know how to move forward in my knowledge, and struggled to ask for help. It is even more difficult when you feel both lost and alone.

Sometimes you want to give up. Sometimes you do give up, multiple times. You might go it again, in a few days, in a few months, in a few years.

There are moments when you see things from a high vantage point— the broader system becomes clear, and you see what you didn’t see before.

For me, I don’t know what it means to “go home” in this metaphor, or what it really means to be “finished.” Maybe to be “finished” in this process means you can do something you couldn’t do before, like bake a cake, or build a drone. But what really remains is your body’s understanding of that journey, and how to walk it again.

The map only goes as far as a discipline is defined, but the landscape continues on and on forever, as big as the known universe. Sometimes you realize that one place bleeds into the next, or that two separate places are striking similar. 

Maybe some day you can show your friends around, or find refuge in traveling it again and again, in new ways.
