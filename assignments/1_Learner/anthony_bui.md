Autobiography as a Learner
==========================

I am always learning in so many different aspects of my life. Here however, when thinking explicitly about *How I Learn*, I chose to focus on learning endeavors that I have chosen to develop expertise over time: practical blockchain applications, illustration, and positivity (through un-learning of negative self-talk) through daily meditation.

When I think about it, I find my learning pattern happens in reverse to what I would describe as effective learning. That is, I tend to go from broad to specific to doing. In summary, I think my learning tends to proceed as follows:

* reading opinions and seeing what experts have to say
* formulating my own opinions through writing and conversing
* reading about a system in detail
* applying the knowledge -- testing or building of learned concepts
* systematic practice
* teaching!

Across varied interests, I find that learning for me often starts with a vague interest. Chances are I'll stumble upon something interesting in reading or conversation or passing. From there, I somewhat inefficiently enter a passive phase of learning. Often, I begin with reading *around* a topic -- often seeking as much context as possible through reflections of what others -- who I perceive have obtained more expertise than I have -- think.

When I feel like I've developed enough context -- often seen as confidence enough to talk about the topic and my goals publicly -- I'll generally enter a second passive phase where I generally load into my head as much knowledge as possible *without actually doing*. Personally, I find this is a bad habit born out of my laziness around switching contexts. But nevertheless, I find it's an important aspect of the way I learBut nevertheless, I find it's an important part of the way I learn. In this step, I find that I'm loading as much superficial knowledge -- as in knowledge I am unlikely to retain -- as possible. For example, often I'll read a blockchain book and gloss over all the "Try it yourself" examples, or read several illustration books or meditation books without actually doing the exercises. This will happen to the point that I'll reading technical material simliar to reading a novel, whereby I'll often skip entire sections or chapters that I don't understand or that require breaking from actual reading.

Once all this knowledge has been loaded into my head, I tend to reach my first point of disinterest. This point is where where my learning most likely stops because it is here when I feel as though I now know enough to make a decision with regards to utility, i.e. will obtaining this knowledge benefit me? Is this knowledge that I can use to further my career? Better my personal interactions? Further my creative practice?

If I don't drop off, I find my next phase involves creating or applying of knowledge. I find that this is when my subconscious starts to do it's magic in that the subject matter tends to pervade my dreams or I'll start to have creative ideas or conversations with regards to the topic. I will continue to imagine, create and build.

Perhaps my favorite part of learning is when I've decided to keep at something. It is then that I'll find more time to remix and play. Once humor gets involved, I understand that my quality of knowledge and confidence in having the knowledge grows exponentially. At this point, my learning becomes much more active. If it's a new technology, I will generally think of a creative project and build it. If it's a new practice, I will generally joke about it and incorporate it into my life with absurdity -- e.g. drawing make-believe animals stitched together from familiar animals.

When I stick with this long enough, I start to get a lot more systematic with my learning in that I will attempt to put time aside daily or weekly to build a habit out of what I am learning.

Ultimately, my learning culminates when I challenge myself to transfer my knowledge to others. Only then do I start to reduce extensive knowledge into systematic learning -- the story and the arc of what learning this skill is like. I also begin to gain mastery as I think much more about how to make learning interesting to another person by adding a layer of humor.
