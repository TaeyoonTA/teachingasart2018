## Autobiography as a learner

 I feel like I learn mostly through the action of doing things, but I think that the process differs based on what I am trying to learn. I will divide it up into 3 categories (see below).

 My learning process pretty much starts the same no matter what I am trying to learn. There is usually a purpose for why I am learning something, so I have to start with identifying what I am trying to learn. This is especially helpful and necessary if I am trying to teach myself something outside of class. Next, I try to assess what I do know and what I don't know. This is also to help guide where I need to focus my energy and time. In this way, I'm attempting to prioritize what is most important to learn or how much time I can allocate. Following this, I would gather information about what I don't know. This is where things start to diverge.

### Learning Concepts
When I am learning things that are more conceptual or based on theory, I rely more on reading and taking notes to absorb the information. When some materials are already thoroughly explained in textbooks and online resources I would rather learn through these mediums. I prefer to learn things visually rather than by listening. However, it helps to have someone explain it, for instance, through a class lecture or talking with someone who knows the material extremely well. I also try if possible, depending on the material, to view other opinions on a topic. I usually will Google about it get view other thoughts on a subject, but I'm not sure if that is a good way to approach it. Either way, I am always taking notes otherwise I will forget what I've read or heard.

### Learning Skills
When I am learning something that is more based in skills, I like to watch someone else do them first in a demo and then imitate it. I think it's really helpful to imitate someone first and then to apply it in new ways in my own work. In most of the studio courses I've taken in the past, this has been the best way for me to learn. It sticks in my mind the most, which may be due to the fact that I am a visual learner. I try to take notes it if it's necessary during this process so I can more easily replicate it.

### Learning Life Skills
In my personal learning, I've learned the most when there is direct communication or through trial and error.

Hopefully all this learning process leads to an understanding of what I was originally trying to learn. I think I usually quit at the stage where my understanding is good enough for me to complete the project I was working on. Often my learning is in service of completing a specific project. This process isn't linear for me and there are lots of times where I am jumping back and forth and adapting the process so I can learn better.
