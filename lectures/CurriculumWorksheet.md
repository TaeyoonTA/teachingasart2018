**#1 Review Curriculum Homework**

**#2 Curriculum Crit**

Last week we each took the role as curriculum creators. Now we are going to switch roles to be someone who reviews curricula. You can imagine yourself as a member of the D.O.E, or the school’s board member who would be critical of a proposed curriculum, specifically attuned to where it would break. Think about questions they may have, such as: *How does this curricula enable a path to college acceptance? How does grading work in this curriculum?*

**#3 Activity**

In pairs we are going to review one another’s curriculum, providing critical feedback. We will then take time to be critical of our own curricula and revise or propose edits based on your conversations and received feedback. 

  1. 10 minutes - close reading of your partner's curricula
  2. 10 mintutes - share constructive criticism and feedback with your partner (each person taking 5 minutes to share with each other)
  3. 5 minutes - think about how you would revise your curriculum based on your conversation 
  4. Discuss your process with the class
